# OceanCC Lagrangian

OceanCC Lagrangian is an experimental extension to a set of machine learning tools used to classify ocean currents. This repository is a working prototype. It replaces the training data approach to the current classificaiton by seeding simulated particles on current sources. (in this case the main EAC jet) using directional velocity filtering. These docs will be extended in the future once the approach has been refined.
